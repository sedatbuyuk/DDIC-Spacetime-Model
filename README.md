# A Microstructural Spacetime Model Based on Density-Driven Internal Contraction (DDIC)

This repository presents a new theoretical model proposing that spacetime curvature emerges from density-induced contraction in a discrete lattice-like microstructure. The model introduces a scalar density field (ρ) and suggests a topological contraction mechanism that bridges general relativity and quantum-scale phenomena.

## Core Concepts

* **DDIC Mechanism:** Spacetime contracts in high-density regions, creating gravitational curvature without invoking traditional stress-energy tensor frameworks.
* **Lattice Topology:** Space is modeled as a hexagonal or tetrahedral lattice where local contractions encode curvature.
* **Quantum Implications:** The model proposes explanations for phenomena like gravitational redshift, light deflection, and event horizons via microstructural changes.
* **Testable Predictions:** Outlines experimental implications, including effects detectable by LIGO or Casimir-like setups.
